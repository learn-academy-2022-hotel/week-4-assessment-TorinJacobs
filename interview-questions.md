# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a kind of programming that breaks code up into chunks, or objects, so that portions of the code are not dependent on other portions in order to execute/function properly. Functional programming is analogous to the continuous string of Christmas lights in a series where if one goes out, they all go out, therefore the code is all dependent on every part of it working to maintain operability.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a way of approaching programming by identifying, writing, and retrieving code similarly to how we identify, and interact with objects in our daily lives. Each object in our lives has some kind of meaning and can often exist and function independently from other objects without any detriment to itself or other objects. In that same manner, OOP, is code that is constructed in the form of an object that can work independently from other objects, but engage as/when needed. Additionally, objects tend to have features within them that can be maninpulated, like a car manufacturer that produces specific models, with different engines, trims, paint, etc. 

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is a number with a decimal point and an integer is a whole number.

Researched answer: Same as above with the addition of floats being non-whole numbers.

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: An implicit return means you don't have to explicitly type "return" to call the method.

Researched answer: Same as above with the addition that the return occurs on the last line of the method automatically.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block is a method in ruby that provides anonymous function capability. It is established by the words do/end and the pipe symbols encapsulate whatever the parameter will be.

Researched answer: An anonymous function passed to a method.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: I don't remember exactly, but It's similar to extracting values from objects in JavaScript by naming the object's key. 

Researched answer: Using dot notation, call the variable and value together, ex.) recipe.values will extract the values of object.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: The passing of data between classes.

2. RSpec: Request specification a language for testing object behavior in the Ruby programming language.

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete are the actions we perform with out data as programmers. CRUD is the checklist to reference to ensure proper data management/execution.

4. Test-driven development: The testing/monitoring of the input and output of code.

5. HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a protocol for transmitting HTML.
